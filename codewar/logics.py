# 5. Palindrome Checker

# Write a function to check whether a given string is a palindrome. Ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

# Example Input:
# "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"

# Expected Output:
# True
# 6. Anagram Checker

# Write a function to determine if two strings are anagrams of each other. Two strings are anagrams if they use the same characters in the same quantity, but in a different order.

# Example Input:
# "listen", "silent"

# Expected Output:
# True
# 7. Binary Search

# Write a function to implement binary search. The function should take a sorted array and a target number as input and return the index of the target number or -1 if not found.

# Example Input:
# arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], target = 5

# Expected Output:
# 2
# 8. Find the First Non-Repeating Character

# Write a function to find the first non-repeating character in a string and return its index. If all characters repeat, return -1.

# Example Input:
# "swiss"

# Expected Output:
# 0 (The first non-repeating character is "s" at index 0)
# 9. Check if Two Numbers Have the Same Digits

# Write a function that checks if two numbers contain the exact same digits (in any order).

# Example Input:
# 12345, 54321

# Expected Output:
# True
# 10. Sum of Digits Until Single Digit

# Write a function that repeatedly sums the digits of a number until a single-digit result is obtained.

# Example Input:
# 9876

# Expected Output:
# 3 (9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 30 â†’ 3 + 0 = 3)
