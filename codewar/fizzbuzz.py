# 2. Number Manipulation: FizzBuzz
# Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, 
# print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz". 
# For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

for number in range(100):
    number += 1
    if (number % 3 == 0) and (number % 5 == 0):
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif (number % 3 == 0):
        print("Fizz")
    elif (number % 5 == 0):
        print("Buzz")
